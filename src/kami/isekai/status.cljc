(ns kami.isekai.status
  "Stat/status-block generator — the isekai 'check your status window' trope
   (levels, HP/MP/ATK/DEF/SPD/LUK). Deliberately separate from chargen: this
   is mechanical data, not a visual, so it isn't auto-merged into
   compose-character's output the way equipment is — call it explicitly
   alongside chargen when a game wants numbers, same as a caller already
   picks kami.isekai.skills entries independently. Rendering a status window/
   HUD from this is up to the caller (kami :hud conventions, same as the rest
   of the catalog).

   race-modifiers/class-modifiers are a SEPARATE map from kami.isekai.races/
   classes (mechanical tuning vs. visual body-plan data), which means they
   can silently drift out of sync when a new race/class is added elsewhere
   and this file isn't updated — that already happened once (:troll and
   :priest landed in races/classes without a matching stats entry here, so
   they silently computed as unmodified base stats). Two separate fixes:
   compute-stats now throws on a race/class id kami.isekai.catalog doesn't
   know at all (a typo); test/chargen_test.cljc separately asserts
   race-modifiers/class-modifiers have an entry for every catalog id (a
   completeness check — the drift bug was a *known* race missing an entry,
   which id-validation alone can't catch)."
