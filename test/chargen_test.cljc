        from its formation neighbour (210+170 half-widths == the 380-unit gap between them at the old offsets).
        This computes each member's real primitive extents instead of trusting a fixed guess."
       ;; 2026-07-08: this check used to use a single dx-only scalar 'footprint' (max over primitives of

       ;; it silently ignored any primitive offset vertically from the entity centre. Real GPU pixel rendering
       ;; of starter-party (test/render_pixel_test.clj) found an actual on-screen overlap the old formula
       ;; missed entirely: chargen's mage `:cloak` accessory hangs DOWN via :dy (not :dx), so its true reach
       ;; was invisible to a dx-only check. Fixed by projecting each primitive onto the ACTUAL axis between
       ;; the two slots being compared (a standard separating-axis-style projection — exact for the
       ;; axis-aligned :circle/:ellipse/:rect/:arc primitives this catalog uses, since none of them carry
