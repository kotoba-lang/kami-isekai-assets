;; Pixel-level proof that a kami-isekai-assets composed monster ACTUALLY renders as real GPU
;; pixels through kami.scene2d + kami.sprite-gpu (kotoba-lang/webgpu) — the same pipeline
;; network-isekai's games already draw every frame through. This closes the gap the 2026-07
;; maturity audit found: this library's `:sprite` EDN had never been rendered to a screen by
;; anything in ITS OWN test/demo suite (network-isekai consumes it, but that lives in a
;; separate repo/org, not this one).
;;
;; Reuses kotoba-lang/webgpu's own real-headless-Chromium/WebGL2 harness (`kami.playwright`)
;; verbatim, in the same style as that repo's test/playwright_frame_test.clj /
;; playwright_anim_test.clj: pack the GPU quads, compile+link the SAME sprite-SDF GLSL fixture
;; those tests use, draw an instanced quad pass into a real WebGL2 canvas, then `readPixels`
;; and count actual colour matches — a check that fails if the render pipeline breaks, not just
;; "compiles"/"didn't throw".
;;
;; This is a .clj (not .cljc) test on purpose: `kami.playwright`/`kami.scene2d`/`kami.sprite-gpu`
;; live in the sibling kotoba-lang/webgpu repo, not this repo's own deps.edn (kami-isekai-assets
;; stays a pure-EDN library with zero deps for everyone who doesn't want the render pipeline).
;; Run via `bb render-test` (this repo's bb.edn) — that task shells out with the working
;; directory set to a sibling kotoba-lang/webgpu checkout, because kami.playwright's bridge
;; script and the GLSL fixtures below are read via cwd-relative paths (matching every other
;; playwright_*_test.clj in that repo) — see bb.edn's `render-test` task doc for the exact
;; sibling-checkout layout this expects (kotoba-lang/{kami-isekai-assets,webgpu,expr} as
;; siblings, the same layout the west-managed superproject already checks these repos out in).

;; ── party case: kami.isekai.render-adapter/presets->scene, exercised end-to-end with a REAL
;; composed party (kami.isekai.party/compose-party party/starter-party) for the first time — the
;; slime case above only ever proved preset->scene (ONE entity). presets->scene (SEVERAL entities,
;; each at its own :offset, in one frame) has existed since day one but had never actually been
;; rendered; only shape/unit-checked (test/chargen_test.cljc's footprint-clearance check, which
;; reasons about the same :offset numbers but never draws a pixel).
;;
;; Camera note: kami.sprite2d.layout's world→screen scale-k (0.34 default × W/900) shrinks an
;; entity's world *position* on the way to screen space, but kami.scene2d/op->quads does NOT
;; apply that same k to a sprite's own primitive sizes (unlike the Canvas2D painter
;; kami.sprite2d.cljs, which does `.scale ctx k k` before drawing — see that file's draw-sprite!).
;; That asymmetry means the WORLD-unit clearance test/chargen_test.cljc already validates for
;; starter-party's formation only maps 1:1 onto SCREEN-pixel clearance at k=1 exactly. `:scale
;; 0.9` here at W=1000 gives scale-k = 0.9*(1000/900) = 1.0, so this test renders at the same
;; scale the clearance math already reasons in — not a workaround, just picking the one camera
;; zoom where "clear in world units" demonstrably means "clear on screen." `:tree-count 0`
;; disables kami.scene2d/tree-quads' default background scatter (90 trees within a 4200-unit
;; spread, drawn unconditionally by frame-quads) — real content this repo's composed entities
;; have nothing to do with, and without it every "is this still background" sample below would
;; be contaminated by whatever tree circles happen to land nearby.
;;
;; A bigger, GENUINELY OUT-OF-SCOPE finding from building this test (documenting, not fixing —
;; it lives in kotoba-lang/webgpu's kami.sprite-gpu, not this repo's render-adapter.cljc):
;; kami.sprite-gpu/prim->quad's :rect case sets the GPU quad's :size (half-extents) directly to
;; a primitive's :w/:h, but the Canvas2D reference painter this catalog's primitive vocabulary was
;; designed against (kami.sprite2d.cljs's `prim!`) draws a :rect via `fillRect(dx-w/2, dy-h/2, w,
;; h)` — i.e. :w/:h are FULL width/height there. Verified directly: a synthetic `[:rect {:w 100
;; :h 50 ...}]` primitive rendered through kami.scene2d/kami.sprite-gpu measures ~202×100 actual
;; on-screen pixels, not ~100×50 — every :rect-shaped primitive in this catalog (swords, cloaks,
;; crowns, satchels, horns, tusks, ...) renders at roughly DOUBLE its intended size through this
;; GPU path relative to the Canvas2D one (circles/ellipses are unaffected — :r/:rx/:ry already
;; mean the same half-extent in both renderers). Because of this, this test does not assert
;; pixel-exact inter-member clearance/background gaps (that would be testing kami.sprite-gpu's
;; sizing, not this repo's render-adapter) — the party.cljc formation fix + chargen_test.cljc's
;; corrected clearance check (both in THIS repo, both about world-unit/Canvas2D-semantics
;; geometry) are verified at the unit level (`bb test`), independent of this GPU-side gap.
