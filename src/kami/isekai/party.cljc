  "Party formation — the isekai adventuring-party trope. `compose-party` takes
   an ordered list of character specs (kami.isekai.chargen/compose-character
   args) and returns each composed character plus a world-space :offset
   [dx dy], arranged in a classic front-line/back-line RPG formation (tank
   front-centre, flanks either side, support at the back). Offsets are in the
   same world units as everything else in the catalog (kami.sprite2d), scaled
   to roughly the spacing network-isekai games already use between entities
   (nocturne's buskers sit ~400-800 units apart) — a caller adds these to a
   spawn point and passes them straight to set-position!."

   ;; the 4-slot offsets are wider than they look at a glance — starter-party's
   ;; slot 0 is always cheat-flagged by convention (the isekai protagonist
   ;; trope), and :cheat? true's aura adds an outer glow ring reaching a 210
   ;; world-unit radius from centre (chargen/cheat-aura), well past a bare
   ;; character's usual ~150-175. At the previous [-190 -180]/[190 -180] top
   ;; row, that aura and the adjacent slot's silhouette had exactly ZERO
   ;; clearance (210+170 half-widths == the 380-unit gap between them,
   ;; found by computing real per-member primitive extents, not eyeballing
   ;; it) — the two would visually touch. Scaled the whole formation ~1.35x
   ;; so every pairwise gap clears (footprint sum + 30 units) using
   ;; starter-party's actual real member footprints, not a guess.
   ;;
   ;; 2026-07-08 correction (found via the first real GPU pixel render of a
   ;; composed party, not just the footprint math above): that footprint
   ;; check only ever measured reach along :dx (horizontal) — it silently
   ;; ignored :dy-offset shapes, so mage's cloak rect (chargen's class accessory,
   ;; `:dy (* head-r 1.6) :h (* head-r 2.6)`, i.e. it hangs DOWN from the
   ;; entity centre, not sideways) was invisible to it. Rendering
   ;; starter-party's actual pixels showed the protagonist's aura (slot 0,
   ;; directly south of the mage in this formation) visibly bleeding into
   ;; the mage's cloak — real, on-screen overlap the old check couldn't see
   ;; because it never looked at :dy. test/chargen_test.cljc's clearance
   ;; check is now direction-aware (projects each primitive onto the actual
   ;; slot-to-slot axis instead of a single dx-only scalar), which correctly
   ;; flags the previous [-260 -240]/[260 -240]/[-260 160]/[260 160] offsets
   ;; as 54.5 world-units short on the slot0↔slot2 (protagonist↔mage) pair.
   ;; Rescaled ~1.25x (was already thin on the earlier 1.35x pass because
   ;; that pass could only see :dx, not the mage's cloak) to restore real
   ;; clearance on every pair, confirmed both by the corrected math and by
   ;; re-rendering the real starter-party through kami.isekai.render-adapter
   ;; (test/render_pixel_test.clj's party case).
