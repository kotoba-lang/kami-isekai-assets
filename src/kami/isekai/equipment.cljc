  "Weapon/held-item silhouettes — composable onto any chargen character.
   Bare-handed characters read as unfinished (a 'knight' with no sword just
   looks like a person in a helm); `equip` appends a small held-item read at
   the character's side, same restrained handful-of-primitives philosophy as
   everything else. `class->weapon` is the default loadout `compose-character`
   applies automatically (a knight gets a sword+shield, a mage a staff, ...);
