  "The single curated preset list — a representative slice across the
   race/class/monster/structure/tensei catalog, not every combination (80
   race×class pairs is a browsing catalog, not a starter pack). This is the
   ONE place the list is defined: scripts/gen_presets.clj (this repo's own
   `bb gen-presets`) and network-isekai's scripts/gen_isekai_assets.clj
   (its Asset Hub deploy step) both consume `presets` directly instead of
   each maintaining their own copy.

   That duplication already happened once — network-isekai's copy grew a
   new entry every round this list changed, but this namespace didn't
   exist yet, so this file's predecessor (a list hardcoded directly in
   scripts/gen_presets.clj) silently fell behind for a dozen rounds until
   this refactor. A single requireable def is the actual fix, not just
   remembering better next time."
